I am a Biostatistics PhD student in the Division of Biostatistics and Department of Statistics at The Ohio State University. My research interests include topics in causal inference, such as the use of synthetic control estimators, matching methods, and propensity score methods in complex and multilevel observational studies. I am also interested in developing novel approaches to evaluating the health impact of large-scale public policy changes. I am a Susan Huntington Dean's Distinguished Graduate Fellow and recipient of a College of Public Health Fellowship.
